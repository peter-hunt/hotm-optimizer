# History of the Project

A-lot-of-math Alert and Nerdy Alert.

Not that much math actually.

I originally started this project when there was only Mithril Powder in the game and Efficient Miner still a discrete increment node. The optimization problem led me to reinvent Multvariable Calculus as the hill climbing algorithm was a multidimensional space with each axis being the level of a perk and the function result as the efficiency. The titanium mining efficiency was a smooth surface with the Efficient Miner over-approximated as a smooth curve and decreased to be tuned later. A float result is obtained from the hill-climbing algorithm, but the integer one can be found by trying a couple surrounding the float result to ensure the best result. However, in that I discovered that both faster and more accurate to even try all the possible levels of the nodes, which somewhat discouraged further development of the optimizer.

I took a break from Skyblock during which the Glacial Tunnels and Mineshafts were released, which was due to my previous ironman profile being unfortunately ratted by a coop scam by a stranger. In my new profile, however, getting to the point of being able to gemstone powder mine and the potential optimize for all kinds of different tasks again, including the Glacial Area which I wasn't familiar with, I restarted the optimizer code project as to eventually benefit other Skyblock players to have a slightly easier mining time with an optimized HOTM tree before maxed powder (although maxed powder would be considered the most optimized HOTM tree for sure). The last project was based on a simple mining speed/fortune/spread initial input and the powder for the calculation, but I realized that there are so many unique and specific stats like the pet, tool, armor bonus and so on, that I might as well organize my code to support all of them in an ultimate HOTM optimizer. That is where this project came from. With a lot more experience in Python and how AI code didn't write good enough code for HOTM optimizer, I made this for me and for all of you guys. Speaking of experience in Python, I had a previous project to recreate Skyblock in Python command line, which was not maintained since long ago because it was mainly for when Skyblock servers were down with the DDOS attack and their implementing of the Cloudfare proxies I'm pretty sure.

## Potentials

Now to speak of the potentials. In my high school Multivariable Calculus class, the Lagrange Multiplier method for optimization was the perfect generalization and formulation for my first optimizer using the multivariable hill-climbing algorithm but with virtuall O(1) time efficiency, so significantly better than my implementation although the same idea. This leads me to thinking if there are direct approaches to the HOTM optimizer even with 3 different powder types, thus 3 different and independent constraints on the same function value like that of Lagrange Multiplier's. Granted that the formula will be much more complicated than just the old HOTM 5 layers all with mithril powder, and that it might also be impossible with an analytic integrals and so on for such a function, there might still be a formula to find the best HOTM powder distribution much faster and obtaining the global maximum.

In addition, to look at the HOTM optimization also might provide valuable insight for Hypixel to balance the HOTM and even HOTF skill tree looking at the strategies and what might be the metas to be nerfed or the ignored to be buffed. On the other hand, a possible QoL can be applied to the HOTM nodes to try to predict the player's setup at each powder level and to make the powder cost step reflect the efficiency-cost ratio. By that, I mean to make the HOTM cost steps and the reward maybe tweaked or changed at a formula so that buying the cheapest relevant upgrade would lead to close-to-optimal results for the players, thus eliminating the need for optimizers like this project, although it is pretty fun to design and implement.

## My Opinions

With how repetitive powder grinding is, it somewhat feels more like a time wall for the players to grind toward before actually mining efficiently instead of a progressive gain balanced from related activities like mining, events, and even maybe mobs. I think removing the need to deliberately powder mine would fit better to Hypixel's vision for the mining progression, although the current one does work and it could be hard to do a total revamp.
